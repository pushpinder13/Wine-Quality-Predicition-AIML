Wine-Quality-Predicition-AIML

The data file winequality-red.csv contains a dataset of 1599 data points with 1 1 features and a label which ranges from 3-
9.The aim of the project is to predict the quality of the wine by training the data on the given data points and then
creating a separate csv file for testing and feedinf the predicted value of quality in a new column and marking it as
good, average or bad. Any value of quality predicted which is less than 6 is marked as 'bad', equal to 6 marked as
â€¢average' and greater than 6 is marked as'good'.Out of 1599 data points, 1000 are used to train the model and the
rest are used for testing.
Technology used- Python3,

The final prediction is based on Random Forest. Train accuracy is around 0.93 which shows that it has low bias.
